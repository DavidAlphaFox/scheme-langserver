## Type inference in scheme-langserver

The fundamental purpose of a type system is to prevent the occurrence of execution errors during the running of a program. Unlike [hindley-milner-type-inferencer](https://github.com/webyrd/hindley-milner-type-inferencer) and many other implementations, scheme-langserver's type inferencer have to respond LSP requests which interleave code position information, like in completion, goto definition and many others, and consume [r6rs](http://www.r6rs.org/)-based code without any specific type annotations. 

Scheme-langserver would implement a usable type inferencer instead of a fully decidable one. According to [Poly Type Inference in Scheme](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/38891838.pdf), the first step is to implement First-order Type System. And, according to [Gradual Typing for Functional Languages](https://www.cs.indiana.edu/~lkuper/talks/gradual/gradual.pdf), it would base on the intuition that the structure of a type may be partially known/unknown at compile-time and the job of the type system is to catch incompatibilities between the known parts of types.

Further, the known part is following [the summary from csug 9.5](https://cisco.github.io/ChezScheme/csug9.5/summary.html#./summary:h0), that we have about 1808 forms to construct a rule-based type inferencer with match` macro.

## Pre-require

### [Chez Scheme](https://cisco.github.io/ChezScheme/);

Chez Scheme is both a programming language and an implementation of that language, with supporting tools and documentation. And it is scheme-langserver's base and target.

A main barrier is that Chez Scheme recently (in 2024) released 10.0.0 version, which has changed a lot building process comparing with previous versions. You may find detailed building documentation [here](https://github.com/cisco/ChezScheme/blob/main/BUILDING).

Scheme-langserver's muti-threaded feature requires Chez Scheme enables --threads option. And it's basically default configuration for Chez Scheme now.

If you're using latest Nixos or relative operating systems, their default Chez Scheme version is 10.0.0.

If you're using Windows, you may do same process in WSL. And please note that, we've not fully testd our work with Chez Scheme's windows version.

>NOTE: I don't recommend install with apt or yum or any others, because we can not confirm they fully provide all we need. 

To install Chez Scheme 10.0.0:
```bash
wget https://github.com/cisco/ChezScheme/releases/download/v10.0.0/csv10.0.0.tar.gz
tar -xf csv10.0.0.tar.gz && cd csv10.0.0
./configure --threads --kernelobj
make && sudo make install
```

### [AKKU](https://akkuscm.org/)

Akku is a language package manager for Scheme. It grabs hold of code and shakes it vigorously until it behaves properly. By default, akku is based on [guile](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/), if you want Chez Scheme version source to compile it yourself, you may find the target [this page](https://gitlab.com/akkuscm/akku/-/releases).

If you're using latest Nixos or relative operating systems, you may directly use AKKU with nix package manager.

As for native on Windows, scheme-langserver requires [AKKU](https://akkuscm.org/) to be native on Windows first now. An essential barrier is the [srfi](https://srfi.schemers.org/), whose library path can't be handled in Windows7. Further discussion is on [tihs page](https://gitlab.com/akkuscm/akku/-/issues/70).

### [chez-exe](https://github.com/gwatt/chez-exe)ï¼›

The goal of this project is to produce standalone executables that are a complete ChezScheme system and contain a scheme program. This works by embedding the ChezScheme bootfiles and a scheme program into the executable. However, as we mentioned [above](#chez-scheme), Chez Scheme 10.0.0 has changed a lot, and default configuration don't work now.

For Chez Scheme's old version (before 10.0.0), chez-exe requires boot files and kernel files. So, the compile command maybe like follows:`scheme --script gen-config.ss --bootpath {path-to-ChezScheme}/{machine-type}/boot/{machine-type}`;

For Chez Scheme 10.0.0, you may need [my own chez-exe](https://github.com/ufo5260987423/chez-exe). The differences you may refer to [this pull request](https://github.com/gwatt/chez-exe/pull/20). And the compile command is altered to `scheme --script gen-config.ss --bootpath {path-to-ChezScheme}/lib/csv${version}/{machine-type}`

If you're using latest Nixos or relative operating systems, you may directly use chez-exe with my own package as following:
```nix
{
  inputs = {
    #before merge
    chez-exe.url = "github:ufo5260987423/chez-exe";
    #after merge
    #chez-exe.url = "github:gwatt/chez-exe";
  };
  outputs = {
    modules = [
       ({
         nixpkgs.overlays = [
            (final : prev : {chez-exe = inputs.chez-exe.packages."{prev.system}"};)
           ];
       })
   ...
   ]
  };
}
```

More details you may refer [this page](https://github.com/gwatt/chez-exe/pull/20).

In addition, for Windows, you can not install chez-exe without WSL.

## Build & Compile Executable File in Linux

We assume that you have already install the above requirements.

The following will produce an executable binary file `run`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ufo5260987423/scheme-langserver
cd scheme-langserver
akku install
bash .akku/env
compile-chez-program run.ss
```

### For WSL

In WSL, please install the original `compile-chez-program` for an unknown exception.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ufo5260987423/scheme-langserver
cd scheme-langserver
~/local/bin/akku install
bash .akku/env
compile-chez-program run.ss
```

If `compile-chez-program` fails with such a message:
```text
compiling run.ss with output to run.so
/usr/sbin/ld: cannot find /usr/local/lib/petite-chez.a: No such file or directory
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
run
```
Please try to look for `petite-chez.a` and copy it to the `/usr/local/lib` directory.

For another message:
```text
cc: fatal error: no input files
compilation terminated.
```
Please check that you install the original one :(

### For Nixos
You may directly search scheme-langserver [here](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&show=akkuPackages.scheme-langserver&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=akkuPackages.scheme-langserver), it will directly install an executable binary file. And this file is softly linked in bash $PATH as `scheme-langserver`.

## Configuration for Editors

### [LunarVim(1.4)](https://www.lunarvim.org/)
Personally, I use [LunarVim(1.4)](https://www.lunarvim.org/) as an out-of-box IDE layer. So, you may configure `~/.config/lvim/config.lua` and add following codes like:

```lua
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("BufRead", {
  pattern = {"*.sld", "*.sls"},
  command = "setfiletype scheme",
})

vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("BufNewFile", {
  pattern = {"*.sld", "*.sls"},
  command = "setfiletype scheme",
})

vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('FileType', {
  pattern = 'scheme',
  callback = function(args)
    vim.lsp.start({
      name = 'scheme-langserver',
      cmd = {'{path-to-run}',
        '~/scheme-langserver.log',
        --enable multi-thread
        'enable',
        --disable type inference, because it's on very early stage.
        'diable',
      },
      root_dir = vim.fs.root(args.buf, {'.gitignore','AKKU.manifest'}),
    })
  end
})

vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('LspAttach', {
  group = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup('UserLspConfig', {}),
  callback = function(ev)
    -- Enable completion triggered by <c-x><c-o>
    vim.bo[ev.buf].omnifunc = 'v:lua.vim.lsp.omnifunc'

    -- Buffer local mappings.
    -- See `:help vim.lsp.*` for documentation on any of the below functions
    local opts = { buffer = ev.buf }
    vim.keymap.set('n', 'gD', vim.lsp.buf.declaration, opts)
    vim.keymap.set('n', 'gd', vim.lsp.buf.definition, opts)
    vim.keymap.set('n', 'K', vim.lsp.buf.hover, opts)
    vim.keymap.set('n', 'gr', vim.lsp.buf.references, opts)
  end,
})

lvim.builtin.cmp.enabled()
lvim.builtin.cmp.sources = {
  { name = 'nvim_lsp' },
  { name = 'luasnip' },
  { name = 'buffer' },
}
```
>NOTE: I have pull request to [mason.nvim](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim) and [mason-lspconfig.nvim](https://github.com/williamboman/mason-lspconfig.nvim). However, there're many corner case and code style work and I finally decided to concentrate on LSP. If anyone want to help, you may raise an issue.

### Some Other Editors

If you want [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html) to embed scheme-langserver, [this issue](https://github.com/ufo5260987423/scheme-langserver/issues/39) suggests [eglot](https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot). But I'm not familiar with Emacs, and you may config it yourself.

If you want [Helix Editor](https://helix-editor.com/) to embed scheme-langserver, [this issue](https://github.com/ufo5260987423/scheme-langserver/issues/41) may give some configurations. And according to my understand, you may config `language.toml` as following:
```
[[language]]
name = "scheme"
scope = "source.scheme"
injection-regex = "scheme"
file-types = ["ss", "scm"]
shebangs = ["scheme", "guile", "chicken"]
comment-token = ";"
indent = { tab-width = 2, unit = " " }
language-servers = [ {path-to-run}]
```

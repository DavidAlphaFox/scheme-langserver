# Overview

This package is a language server protocol implementation helping coding. It provides completion and will provide many other functionalities. These functionalities are established on the basis of static code analysis and distinguished from Geiser and many other coding plugins. For example, Geiser can only complete top-level binding identifiers and these do not include local bindings.

This package is published with Akku(https://akkuscm.org/), which is a language package manager for Scheme. 

This package has been tested with Chez Scheme versions 9.4 and 9.5.

This is for â˜­. Coders of all countries, unite!
